         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſame day the Major-generall omitted no oportunity, went the neareſt way from <hi>Doncaſter</hi> to <hi>Sheffield,</hi> being accompanied with Colonell <hi>Bright,</hi> (who at firſt valued not the Caſtle<hi>:)</hi> but when the Major-generall had viewed it, he found it to be a very conſiderable ſtrength, both for naturall ſcituation, being in a triangle with two Rivers, the water deep in the Weſt and Eaſt ſides of the Caſtle, flackered on all ſides, a ſtrong Fort before the gate palliſado'd, a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

The ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell returned the next morning, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2. with a Letter from the Earle of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> wherein the Major-generall was left to his own diſcretion, with this proviſo, not to in danger men; which Letter the Major-generall did communicate to the reſt of the Officers, who were very willing to goe on in that enterpriſe, and to be directed to him: And thereupon they marched on towards <hi>Sheffield,</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Bright</hi> went to <hi>Yorke,</hi> to bring two battering-peeces from thence (as he did undertake) againſt Sunday night, we to <hi>Sheffield</hi> Mannor, being welcommed and received with great acclamations, and the many prayers of that well-affected people. In the edge of the Parke we planted the Culverin (having before ſent a party of horſe and foot into the Towne) and there did diſcharge three great ſhot with great dexterity into the Caſtle, one whereof ſhot through the Governours chamber: and thereafter we marched through the upper part of the Parke, and drew a great circumference with our Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to eſchew the danger of the Caſtle, and entred at the upper end of the Towne, where the Towns-men with great joy drew down the Ordnance to the market-place: and thereafter the Major-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſummoned them by a Trumpeter in the Earle of <hi>Mancheſters</hi> name, to ſurrender the place into his hands for King and Parliament; but they diſcharged three ſhot at the Trumpeter, who could not get audience. All this night all degrees and ſexes with all cheerfulneſſe cut ſads, and brought them to make the battery croſſe the ſtreet,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125236:3"/>
within forty yeards of the Caſtle, where the carefull and vigilant Major-generall was himſelfe working, incouraging others with his preſence, cheerfull words, and example, the battery was well nigh perfected this night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> 3. Captaine <hi>Sands</hi> captaine of the Pioniers, and the maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Gunner, attended the Major generall to view the little Towre by the River, that flauncked two quarters of the Caſtle, and the mount be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gate, to the end that they ſhould finde out ſome convenient place to raiſe a battery to beat it downe, which might be very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for us, to the gaining of the caſtle. Whereupon the Captaine and Gunner were both ſhot, the one through the theigh, and the other through the ſhoulder, whereof they both after dyed, they were ſhot in a place which was out of all view of the Caſtle, having both houſes and hay betwixt them and it, this night we helped and raiſed the battery, made the Platforme, and the Major Generall, with Major <hi>Hamilton,</hi> went to view the Caſtle more narrowly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4. After two Sermons this day, all the people went to erect a new battery, and at night the Major Generall accompanied with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Forbus</hi> and major <hi>Hamilton,</hi> went to view a ſluce that was ſtopt to keep the water deep about the eaſt ſide of the Caſtle, which he thought to draine the more to facilitate his buſineſſe, this night was ſpent by him with great toile, and no ſmall danger, the Ordnance were planted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5. The Ordnance began to batter, which made the beſieged more milde then they were before, and their Governour received our ſummons, and returned us anſwer that the Caſtle was intruſted unto him by his Majeſtie, which trust he valued more then his life: at night the Major Generall by threates, promiſes and money, got together ſome Colliers to myne the Caſtle, which they found not to feaſable, it being builded on a rock. This day the Major generall wrote to the Earle of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> that Ammunition and Ball was likely to be wanting, and the Major generall went to the Iron Mils, and ſet men a work to make moulds for to caſt Balls for our pieces, which was foorthwith done; this night the Major generall attempted to break up the Sluce through the Dame, to let out the water of that corner againſt the Orchard, on the eaſt ſide of the Caſtle, which could not take effect. And this night we

This day the enemy ſhot ſome great Granadoes into the Towne and Church-yeard, which did no execution; the ſame day two Gunners were ſhot through the Port-holes, in the fingers by the enmy, the Major general ſent Major <hi>Alford</hi> to conduct the ordnance with four Troopes of Horſe from <hi>Doncaſter</hi> to us, hearing that the 500. foot were diminiſhed to one, and that the horſe were not above two hundred in all.

We got in this Caſtle abundance of proviſion, which was ſold for the uſe of the Army, to the Towne of <hi>Sheffield,</hi> for 250 li. We found many hundreds of Granado's, and many hundreds of round ſhot from the Cannon to the Minion, ten barrels of powder, eight Iron peeces, five hundred Armes, and ſome other proviſions and neceſſaries for the Caſtle, two Morter-pieces.</p>

The Colonell immediately acquaints the Major Generall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who gave ſafe conduct unto the Gentleman, before whom the Major Generall carried himſelfe very highly, and diſdained to ſend them ſummons becauſe they made ſmall accompt of the Earle of <hi>Mancheſters</hi> ſummons, which were ſent them from <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> by which meanes the Gentleman ſeeing the Major Generalls reſolution was deſirous to ſecure his own life, and (if he could) the houſe which at as great a valew as himſelfe, the Gentleman went in, and told the Governour of the Major Generall Carriage and reſolution (which proved effectuall for the ſpeedy deliuery of the Caſtle) who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vowed to make it his Grave, was now reſolved to come to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, wherefore hee came out himſelfe, and two others to the Major Generall, without any Hoſtages asked, and thereafter agreed upon the incloſed Articles.</p>

               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 21. The Governour marched forth with 200 men: All the Officers (himſelfe excepted) laid downe their Armes, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Protections from the Major-generall, (as they of <hi>Sheffield)</hi> which were confirmed by the Earle of <hi>Mancheſter:</hi> The common Souldiers went to their owne homes; the Governour had ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that went to <hi>Tutbury</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> with him, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed by Major <hi>Alford</hi> with foure Troops of horſe, who were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled thus; one Troop in the Van, another in the Reare, and a Troop in each Flanck of the Governour and his followers. There was found in this Caſtle 500 Armes, foure barrels of powder, Match and Bullet proportionable, eight peeces of Ordnance, and proviſion for the garriſon, which was given over by the Major-generall. Out hoſtages, Major <hi>Eyre</hi> and Major ſeeing the faire demeanour and affability of the Major-generall, and hearing the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (whoſe affections were very much united to him) ſpeake very much of his goodneſſe towards them, in not ſuffering them to be oppreſſed, and hearing of the gallantry of the man at the late ſiege of <hi>Yorke.</hi> and ſome of them being eye-witneſſes of his wiſdome and valour at the battell of <hi>Longmoſten</hi> moore they were glad to bee conquered by him and thought it their happineſſe to be acquainted with him and reſolved never after to carry Armes againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, finding (beyond expectation) the good carriage and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of our Officers and Souldiers towards all, and they deſired the Earle of <hi>Mancheſters</hi> protection which was granted them at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne,</hi> and now are returned to their owne habitations.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord did give a bleſſing to the carefull endevours and undertakings of the Major-generall, and the other Officers, who with an handfull of men poſſeſt the enemy with feare, and reduced that whole countrey to the obedience of King and Parliament: And uwon the 22 day we marched to <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Redford,</hi> and thence on the 23 to <hi>Littleburgh,</hi> and thence on the 24 to <hi>Gainsborow,</hi> where now we remaine, not ſixe men fewer then when we left <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> onely ſome few are ſickened. The Lord give us thankfull hearts for this his goodneſſe towards us and crown this worke begun, to his owne glory, and our comfort. Amen.</p>
